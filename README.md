# Sentiment Analysis Flask Application for Nexus Platform

> This repository contains a **Flask-based Sentiment Analysis API** developed for the **Nexus mental health platform**. Nexus is a web application that enables users to interact through social forums, complete mental health assessments, and book appointments with mental health professionals. The platform also provides a dedicated space for doctors, where they can be booked by users, view forum discussions, and offer professional advice.

## Project Overview

The API provides **sentiment and mental health analysis models** that are integrated into the Nexus website. These models support content moderation, emotional understanding, and mental health assessment through machine learning–based sentiment analysis.

The system includes **two main models**, each serving a different purpose within the platform.

## Models Description

### 1. Hate Speech & Forum Sentiment Analysis Model

* Used in **Nexus social forums**
* Detects:

  * Hate speech

### 2. Depression Sentiment Analysis Model

This model is used in the **depression assessment feature** on the Nexus website.
The assessment is divided into **three components**:

1. **Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI)**

   * Standard psychological questionnaire for depression assessment

2. **General Sentiment Analysis**

   * Classifies user input into **positive** or **negative** sentiment

3. **Custom Depression Detection Model**

   * A machine learning model specifically trained to detect depression-related linguistic patterns

#### Decision-Level Fusion

The final depression assessment result is produced using **Decision-Level Fusion**, combining the outputs of:

* Beck’s Depression Inventory
* General sentiment analysis
* Custom depression model

This fusion approach improves **robustness and reliability** of the final prediction.
